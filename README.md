This is the repository for my thesis, *Gauging the State-of-the-art for Foresight Weight Pruning on Neural Networks*: [Paper](https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1107&context=csceuht)

## Setup
- Clone [`shrinkbench`](https://github.com/JJGO/shrinkbench) into the root folder of this repository.
- Add a `data` folder into the root folder of this repository.
- Use torchvision to download necessary datasets into `data` folder (MNIST, CIFAR).
- Manually download other datasets into `data` folder (ImageNet).
- Follow `shrinkbench` guidelines for dataset folder structure.
